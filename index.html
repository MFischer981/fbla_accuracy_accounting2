            <h1>Why do I need an accounting firm?</h1>
            <p>Businesses employ accounting firms to handle important financial tasks. Public companies must follow
                accounting rules set by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and following Generally Accepted
                Accounting Principles (GAAP). The SEC requires public companies to hire external accounting firms to
                audit their financial statements. Accounting firms specialize in other financial tasks, such as tax,
                management consulting, mergers and acquisitions and forensic accounting. The types of accounting firms
                required by a business depend on their accounting and business needs.</p>

        <div class="question grey_background">
            <h1>How do I know what expenses are tax deductible?</h1>
            <p>The IRS is constantly revising and changing tax codes. That is just one of many reasons why retaining
                the services of an outside accounting for both regular accounting/payroll and taxes is a great ideas.
                Your certified, professional accountant will be up to date on what can and can’t be written off as a
                tax deductible. They can also help you maximize the potential benefit of your purchases and expenses
                when you’re filing your taxes. Typically, purchases and expenses deemed necessary can be treated as tax
                deductible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question white_background">
            <h1>How does better accounting affect my bottom line?</h1>
            <p>Many small- and mid-size businesses fail to adequately measure and manage their finances, even though
                poor financial
                management is a major cause of business failure. If you don’t have good financial practices in place,
                your business
                could suffer in a number of ways, including lost revenue, insufficient tax planning, and missed
                financial
                opportunities. A great monthly accounting service will handle your profit and loss statements, monthly
                balance
                sheets, and regular account reconciliation to help you take back control of your finances without much
                effort on
                your part. </p>

        <div class="question grey_background">
